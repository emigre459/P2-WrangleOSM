    "# Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data for SW West Virginia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "In order to develop my data wrangling skills, I am auditing and organizing the OpenStreetMap data for SW West Virginia. I chose West Virginia for multiple reasons:\n",
    "1. My wife's family is from there (and most still live in the state) \n",
    "2. I assumed that (like with most self-reported or survey-based data collection efforts), a state with a high proportion of poor and rural areas is likely to have very poor data coverage and quality. This is something that my work on map data may help\n",
    "3. The state of WV is an area racked by a number of unfortunate statistics, not the least of which is [a very high drug overdose rate](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html). This area of West Virginia (in particular, Huntington, WV) [suffers particularly badly](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/29/534868012/what-happens-when-the-heroin-epidemic-hits-small-town-america), with the city of Huntington sometimes being called the drug overdose death capital of America.\n",
    "\n",
    "In wrangling the data for this region of the US, I hope to provide some value to an otherwise ignored set of communities. It is my hope that I will be able to take my progress here and push the audited data to OpenStreetMap as a final step."

    "## Project Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to tackle this project using the following steps (mostly included here for my own mental organization, but hopefully also helpful for anyone following this work too!):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample the data to generate a relatively small data set (e.g. 1-10 MB) that I can sift through to identify recurring concerns as part of my data audit. The code I will use for sampling the data is called *SampleMapData_Small.py*. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Audit the data sample in the tradition of the Udacity Data Wrangling course, using NumPy and Pandas in Python. This will entail:\n",
    "    1. **Auditing data validity:** do the data conform to a pre-defined data schema? In the case of this project, a relevant question would be *Do the tags include zip codes that are within the region of interest?*\n",
    "    2. **Auditing data accuracy:** do the data conform to some gold standard? An example of this will likely be zip codes only being 5 or 9 digits long.\n",
    "    3. **Auditing data completeness:** one approach I may take to this is ensuring that cities or counties I know should be included in the region I'm parsing are actually recorded in the data. Given the region chosen here, one obvious audit that will need to occur is identifying easily the non-WV data in the set. While these data are not inherently invalid, different state policies regarding the naming of roads, counties, etc. may have an impact on the seeming validity of the data at hand and should be identified early.\n",
    "    4. **Auditing data consistency:** I will investigate this by looking across tags of the same type to ensure a standard format is being followed throughout and, if it is not, determining if a correction is needed to answer the questions of greatest interest to me. I'll also investigate other issues of internal consistency as they arise.\n",
    "    5. **Auditing data uniformity:** for these data, this will likely take the form of checking whether data values are within a reasonable range (e.g. no latitudes or longitudes well outside the region of interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check to see if more audit problems are found when sampling a larger data set than previously. Keep iterating on this approach of \"increase sample size, sample, audit\" until no new audit failures are found in the full data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Correct the data problems identified in the audits as part of the CSV data export process that follows the data schema provided by the Udacity team. This schema creates tables tracking `nodes`, `node_tags`, `ways`, `ways_tags`, and `ways_nodes` and allows for the creation of the SQL database needed for recording these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a SQL database with the provided schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Import the CSV data files (one per SQL table) into the SQL database created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Query this database in a variety of ways to:\n",
    "    1. Check to make sure no other auditing errors exist. If any are found, deal with them by modifying the auditing code, re-creating the CSV files, and removing then re-adding records in the SQL database (if necessary).\n",
    "    2. Determine some descriptive aspects of the data. For example, data-oriented queries of interest could include the number of users contributing and identifying some representative contributions of the highest-frequency contributors. This could identify any recurring issues with the data these individuals are supplying and speed up any further auditing that may be needed. Region-specific auditing would include things like determining if the number of cities and counties are accurate. Statistics specifically mentioned in the project rubric (with some additions from me) are:\n",
    "        1. Size of all files used in this project\n",
    "        2. Number of unique users\n",
    "        3. Number of nodes and ways\n",
    "        5. Numbers of nodes lacking any child tags to describe them beyond their latitude/longitude\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Investigate any other interesting counts present in the data, such as:\n",
    "        1. The number of unincorporated townships vs. the number of cities/villages\n",
    "        2. Comparing the number of residential properties to the number of commercial properties.         \n",
    "        3. WV is known by many to have issues with the presence (or lack thereof) of basic infrastructure needs, given its high density of rural locations. As such, I'll also explore how the count of residences compares to the count of:\n",
    "            * grocery stores, \n",
    "            * restaurants, \n",
    "            * alcohol serving-selling businesses, and \n",
    "            * hospitals + doctor offices \n",
    "        \n",
    "        This will potentially illuminate the issue of \"healthcare and food deserts.\" The healthcare component in particular is relevant to the aforementioned overdose concerns for this area. I include alcohol-oriented establishments in these results to replicate [a similar study done in 2013](https://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2013/12/06/top-bar-and-pizza-cities/3882089/) regarding the number of bars per capita vs. food options per capita. In my case, I plan to compare the different counties in terms of their ratios of alcohol to food, alcohol to healthcare, and fast food to healthcare, among other combinations."

Doing so reduced the sampled file (with sample frequency = 1000 tags) from 6,832 lines to 4,582 lines."

As a result, this will be an issue that needs to remain for now, until a gold standard data set for business names can be identified and used in the auditing process (e.g. by comparing `k=\"name\"` values to the list of known businesses and extracting the business type label from that same list to put into the OSM data).\n"

This isn't a perfect solution, as the ones with colons (e.g. 11111:22222) are clearly meant to indicate a range of zip codes, but without a good bit more GIS-based calculation, it's impossible to tell what that range is meant to be. As such, I'll simply include the beginning and end zips of that range as individual records.\n",

    "### State/County Naming \n",
    "            \n",
    "**County and state names are inconsistent**, depending upon which system generated them (e.g. GNIS, Tiger, etc.). This is important, as so many features of WV are referenced by county by WV residents, thus any analysis will need to be based off of counties to have any intuitive value to residents (and likely the same is true of state and local legislators). Also, if there are states being recorded that are clearly not supposed to be within the territory sampled, we need to correct that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some issues identified in this area:**\n",
    "1. The state name is included with the county name (e.g. `tiger:county` = \"County, State (2-letter)\") and not as a separate data field\n",
    "2. Some (ways, presumably) also include *lists* of county,state entries in a single tag, separated by colons or semicolons (sometimes with, sometimes without, leading and trailing spaces for each item in the list).\n",
    "3. The county names are referenced by differing tag keys across the dataset (e.g. `gnis:county_name` + `addr:state`; OR `gnis:County` + `gnis:ST_alpha`; and many others)\n",
    "4. Formatting is inconsistent for the state names, with the first letter sometimes being capitalized (e.g. 'Wv'), both letters being capitalization (e.g. 'WV'), neither being capitalized (e.g. 'wv'), or the state's full name being utilized (e.g. 'West Virginia').\n",
    "5. Strangely, \"CA\" is listed as one of the states found in this OSM file. That is clearly wrong.\n",
    "6. The tags only include a numeric `gnis:county_id` and `gnis:state_id` for some nodes and ways, typically amenities and shops (e.g. instead of naming the county/state as they do for non-commercial nodes). \n",
    "    1. These commercial locations also typically lack street addresses, only including the requisite longitude and latitude. \n",
    "\n",

    "**I will correct these issues during export into CSV files for the SQL tables by (these are referenced by preceding issue numbers, resp.):**\n",

    "2.  Extracting each state/county name from the list and storing in a separate tag record for the node/way in question\n",
    "3. Auditing done by `Audit_Simple.py` has revealed that the following state and county tags are most relevant to our analysis here, and these will be the ones that are the focus of extraction:\n",
    "    * **Types of County Tags**:\n",
    "        * `gnis:County`\n",
    "        * `gnis:County_num`\n",
    "        * `gnis:county_id`\n",

    "        * `nist:state_fips`\n",
    "4. The standard we will be using here will be two-letter state names with both letters capitalized.\n",
    "5. Further analysis of the OSM file shows that this is just one node and that it relates to a school in Shady Spring, WV, not Shady Spring, CA. As such, this node (ID 398603731) has been flagged as one whose tag key `addr:state` needs to have its value changed from 'CA' to 'WV'.\n",
    "6. I can create consistency by developing a mapping algorithm for county/state ID numbers to county and state names, using a download of historic US Census Bureau FIPS codes to ensure that the proper mapping and vintage of data set are being utilized. Counties will be recorded as `addr:county` and states will be `addr:state`.\n",
    "    1. The problem of commercial locations lacking street addresses is beyond the scope of this project, as it requires substantial additional GIS data that is supposed to be provided by OSM in the first place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "NOTE: the 2007 import of USGS GNIS data into OpenStreetMaps had the fields `gnis:County_num` and `gnis:ST_num` which are the county and state FIPS codes, resp. The 2009 import of USGS GNIS data had similar fields, but with slightly different tag keys. These were `gnis:county_id` and `gnis:state_id`, which are also FIPS codes. **As such, my extraction of these data will include mapping these numbers to their actual names, as per these FIPS code mappings, using data downloaded from the US Census Bureau for FIPS codes.** [Please see here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/USGS_GNIS#Other_Tags) for the reference regarding these import actions for OSM and [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html) for the 2010 FIPS code data used in this project."

    "# Conclusions: Thoughts on Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we've cleaned these data pretty well for our purposes and answered (at least in part) some interesting questions with it. However, there is always room for improvement! Here are some potential future directions for the wrangling and analysis that came up (largely sumamrized and collated from within the earlier narrative text):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business in the OSM data are often not identified as being of a specific type (e.g. 'shop' or 'amenity' keys).** This obviously makes analysis much more difficult and incomplete. A correction for this would be to develop a gold standard list of known businesses and extracting the business type label from that same list to put into the OSM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Our assumption that lists of zip codes using colons are exhaustive, but more likely they are meant to be *ranges* of zip codes represented only by the beginning and ending zip code.** More GIS-based analysis would need to be done to determine if this is true and, if so, what zip codes are needed to make those truncated lists exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Many commercial locations appear to only have latitude/longitude coordinates, not street addresses, associated with them.** This makes human-readable analysis difficult. As such, it would be useful to run these coordinates through another map source (e.g. Google) to see if physical addresses can be generated from the coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Our analysis of incorporated vs. unincorporated areas of the region seems flawed due to the low number of incorporated locations.** As discussed earlier, the best way to approach this is likely to generate a list of county seats (generated from an external source, like Wikipedia) from the list of counties present in this data set and do some spot checks to ensure that my logic of \"county seats are always incorporated\" is generally accurate and adds something useful to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Our analysis of food and healthcare deserts is a bit limited as we don't have good population count data.** In order to compare to existing studies, which are typically reported in per capita format, we would need to have more complete knowledge regarding the number of people actually living in the region, instead of having to make assumptions about the per-household resident count. Also, this analysis could be expanded in an interesting (and more useful to policy-makers) way by grouping the results by each county in the data set."
