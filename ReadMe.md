# SQL Schema Notes
## If the element top level tag is "node":
The dictionary returned should have the format {"node": .., "node_tags": ...}

The "node" field should hold a dictionary of the following top level node attributes:
- id
- user
- uid
- version
- lat
- lon
- timestamp
- changeset
All other attributes can be ignored

The "node_tags" field should hold a list of dictionaries, one per secondary tag. Secondary tags are
child tags of node which have the tag name/type: "tag". Each dictionary should have the following
fields from the secondary tag attributes:
- id: the top level node id attribute value
- key: the full tag "k" attribute value if no colon is present or the characters after the colon if one is.
- value: the tag "v" attribute value
- type: either the characters before the colon in the tag "k" value or "regular" if a colon
        is not present.

Additionally,

- if the tag "k" value contains problematic characters, the tag should be ignored
- if the tag "k" value contains a ":" the characters before the ":" should be set as the tag type
  and characters after the ":" should be set as the tag key
- if there are additional ":" in the "k" value they should be ignored and kept as part of
  the tag key. For example:

  <tag k="addr:street:name" v="Lincoln"/>
  should be turned into
  {'id': 12345, 'key': 'street:name', 'value': 'Lincoln', 'type': 'addr'}

- If a node has no secondary tags then the "node_tags" field should just contain an empty list.

## If the element top level tag is "way":
The dictionary should have the format {"way": ..., "way_tags": ..., "way_nodes": ...}

The "way" field should hold a dictionary of the following top level way attributes:
- id
- user
- uid
- version
- timestamp
- changeset

All other attributes can be ignored

The "way_tags" field should again hold a list of dictionaries, following the exact same rules as
for "node_tags".

Additionally, the dictionary should have a field "way_nodes". "way_nodes" should hold a list of
dictionaries, one for each nd child tag.  Each dictionary should have the fields:
- id: the top level element (way) id
- node_id: the ref attribute value of the nd tag
- position: the index starting at 0 of the nd tag i.e. what order the nd tag appears within
            the way element
